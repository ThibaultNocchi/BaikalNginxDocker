# Baikal Nginx Docker

This is a simple Docker image for the [Ba√Økal CalDAV and CardDAV server](https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal).

It bundles the PHP code along with a simple Nginx configuration to serve it.

Feel free to make a PR or an issue if you feel it is missing something.

## Deploy

The Docker image is currently available on linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
